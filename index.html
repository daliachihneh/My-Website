      <p>A vital part of Manchester's heritage has finally been marked and immortalised within an official plaque in Ancoats.</p>
      <p> Although the area has been known as Manchester's Little Italy for some time now, with annual festivals celebrating the Italian heritage of many living nearby, it has finally been officially recognised as a historical site with a plaque.</p>

      <p> According to Manchester City Council, the Little Italy name was most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after Italian families rushed to the UK for a better life away from the political and economic situation.
